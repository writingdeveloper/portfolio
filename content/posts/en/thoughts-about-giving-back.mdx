# Thoughts about giving back

It's been about three and a half months since I arrived in the United States. During this time, I got a lot of help from the other people. Thanks to them, I've been able to travel, save money on insurance, and eat out occasionally.

## Gratitude and Forgiveness

My colleagues have been incredibly supportive in helping me integrate into the workplace. Of course, there have been some interpersonal challenges along the way, but I've come to accept that no one is perfect. I choose to focus on the positive side and be grateful for the help I've received.

## Lessons from Reading

I've been reading "The 48 Laws of Power" and I'm nearly finished with it. The book demonstrates both the utility and ethical concerns of its principles. It's a fascinating read that made me think deeply about human nature and social dynamics.

## Key Takeaway

The biggest realization I've had is that there are no free meals. It's important to always consider reciprocity and the costs of help received. When someone helps you, think about how you can give back. This mindset has changed how I approach relationships and interactions in both personal and professional settings.
