# Adopting Keystatic CMS

While running my blog, manually creating MDX files every time was inconvenient. I had to remember the frontmatter format, follow file naming conventions, and a single typo could break the build. That's why I decided to adopt Keystatic, a file-based CMS.

## What is Keystatic?

Keystatic is a file-based CMS built by Thinkmill. It provides a web-based editor UI while keeping the existing MDX/Markdown file structure intact. No database is needed, and content is stored directly in the Git repository.

## Adoption Process

The adoption was simpler than expected:

1. Install `@keystatic/core` and `@keystatic/next` packages
2. Define a collection in `keystatic.config.ts` matching the existing frontmatter schema
3. Add an Admin UI route at `/keystatic` in the Next.js App Router
4. Exclude the `/keystatic` path from the i18n middleware

## Benefits

- **Web-based editor**: Write and edit posts directly in the browser
- **Preserves existing structure**: File-based, so no changes needed to the existing MDX reading logic
- **Type safety**: Schema defined in TypeScript prevents frontmatter errors
- **Local development friendly**: Just run `npm run dev` and access `/keystatic` right away
