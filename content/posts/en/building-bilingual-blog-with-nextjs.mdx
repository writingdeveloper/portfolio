# Building a Bilingual Blog with Next.js

While running my developer portfolio blog, I wanted to provide content in both Korean and English. To reach both Korean-speaking and English-speaking audiences, I built a bilingual content system.

## Why Bilingual?

As a developer running a tech blog, language barriers are a major constraint. Writing only in Korean makes it difficult to reach a global audience, while writing only in English reduces engagement with the Korean community.

## Tech Stack

I used the following technologies to implement the bilingual blog:

- **Next.js App Router**: Language-specific page separation with `[locale]` dynamic routing
- **next-intl**: UI translation and routing management
- **Keystatic CMS**: Content management with language-specific collections
- **Directory-based separation**: `content/posts/ko/` and `content/posts/en/`

## SEO Optimization

SEO is particularly important for a bilingual blog:

1. **hreflang tags**: Specify alternate language URLs for each page
2. **Sitemap alternates**: Help search engines correctly index language versions
3. **Independent metadata**: Unique title, description, and OG images for each language version

## Translation Workflow

I built an AI-powered translation workflow. Using Claude Code, I check for untranslated posts and translate Korean originals into English. High-quality translations are possible without any API costs, using only the existing subscription.

## Conclusion

A bilingual blog is a powerful tool for reaching a wider audience. The combination of Next.js App Router and next-intl is an excellent tech stack for implementing this.
