# Learn English with ChatGPT and experience the use of English in interviews

It has been 1 month and 3 weeks since I arrived from South Korea. A lot has happened since then, but the most obvious thought has been about English.

I can talk to natives in the US and usually understand what they are saying. But still, it's really hard to know the exact meanings naturally.

People in North Carolina say it's hard to hear English with their accents, but I don't feel like there's that much of a difference.

## Learning English with AI Tools

Nowadays, I learn English with ChatGPT and DeepL translator. Their AI technologies are really amazing and it will change the world I believe. I use a few methods to learn English. First, I just write my diary in Korean language and then I write it in English. And check with DeepL translator and finally, use the DeepL Write function to check alternative words or sentences. When I was young, I learned English in the academy for a long time, and it takes a lot of time and money. But it seems that for now, with some AI tools, it could be free and efficient ways to learn some languages.

## Interview Experience

Recently, I interviewed at a company and I felt that I need to learn English more. Not only that, I have to learn how to talk and how to choose what to talk about. After the interview, I remembered what I said in the interview and I realized that in the interview I said things that I didn't need to say. This happened because of lack of interview experience and understanding of the culture of speaking in the US.

## Finding Ways to Practice

To solve this problem, I need to talk with English speakers. But still it's really hard to practice in this environment because, in this company, so many people use Spanish.

So I have to speak English myself, and actually this method looks fine. Or I can use some Google Chrome extensions to talk with a microphone. I use the "Talk-to-ChatGPT" extension for this. It can help to use a mic in ChatGPT and I can feel like talking to someone.

This kind of AI-powered language learning has been a game changer for me, and I believe it will continue to improve over time.
